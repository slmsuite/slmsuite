        Perform wavefront calibration by
        `iteratively interfering superpixel patches on the SLM
        <https://doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2010.85>`_.
        This procedure measures the wavefront phase and amplitude.

        Interference occurs at a given ``calibration_points`` in the camera's imaging plane.
        It is at each point where the computed correction is ideal; the further away
        from each point, the less ideal the correction is.
        Correction at many points over the plane permits a better understanding of the
        aberration and greater possibility of compensation.

        Sets :attr:`~slmsuite.hardware.cameraslms.FourierSLM.calibrations["wavefront"]`.
        Run :meth:`~slmsuite.hardware.cameraslms.FourierSLM.wavefront_calibration_process`
        afterwards to produce the usable calibration which can be written to the SLM.

        Note
        ~~~~
        A Fourier calibration must be loaded.

        Tip
        ~~~
        If *only amplitude calibration* is desired,
        use ``phase_steps=None`` to omit the more time-consuming phase calibration.

        Tip
        ~~~
        Use ``phase_steps=1`` for faster calibration. This fits the phase fringes of an
        image rather than scanning the fringes over a single camera pixel over many
        ``phase_steps``. This is usually optimal except in cases with excessive noise.

        Parameters
        ----------
        calibration_points : (float, float) OR numpy.ndarray OR None
            Position(s) in the camera domain where interference occurs.
            For multiple positions, this must be of shape ``(2, N)``.
            This is naturally in the ``"ij"`` basis.
            If ``None``, densely fills the camera field of view with calibration points.
        superpixel_size : int
            The width and height in pixels of each SLM superpixel.
            If this is not a devisor of both dimensions in the SLM's :attr:`shape`,
            then superpixels at the edge of the SLM may be cropped and give undefined results.
            Currently, superpixels are forced to be square, and this value must be a scalar.
        reference_superpixels : (int,int) OR numpy.ndarray of int OR None
            The coordinate(s) of the superpixel(s) to reference from.
            For multiple positions, this must be of shape ``(2, N)``.
            Defaults to the center of the SLM if ``None``. If multiple calibration
            points are requested when ``None``, then the references are clustered at the center.
        exclude_superpixels : (int, int) OR numpy.ndarray OR None
            If in ``(nx, ny)`` form, optionally exclude superpixels from the margin,
            That is, the ``nx`` superpixels are omitted from the left and right sides
            of the SLM, with the same for ``ny``. As power is
            typically concentrated in the center of the SLM, this function is useful for
            excluding points that are known to be blocked (e.g. with an iris or other
            pupil), or for quickly testing calibration at the most relevant points.
            Otherwise, if exclude_superpixels is an image with the same dimension as the
            superpixeled SLM, this image is interpreted as a denylist.
            Defaults to ``None``, where no superpixels are excluded.
        test_index : int OR None
            If ``int``, then tests the scheduled calibration corresponding to this index.
            Defaults to ``None``, which runs the full wavefront calibration instead of
            testing at only one index.

            Note
            ~~~~
            Scheduling is relative to the reference superpixel(s), and a change to the
            reference may also shift the positions of the test superpixels for the given index.
        field_point : (float, float)
            Position in the camera domain where the field (pixels not included in superpixels)
            is blazed toward in order to reduce light in the camera's field. The suggested
            approach is to set this outside the field of view of the camera and make
            sure that other diffraction orders are far from the ``calibration_points``.
            Defaults to no blaze (``(0,0)`` in ``"kxy"`` units).
        field_point_units : str
            A unit compatible with
            :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.toolbox.convert_vector()`.
            Defaults to ``"kxy"``.

            Tip
            ~~~
            Setting one coordinate of ``field_point`` to zero is suggested
            to minimize higher order diffraction.
        phase_steps : int OR None
            The number of interference phases to measure.
            If ``phase_steps`` is 1 (the default), does a one-shot fit on the interference
            pattern to improve speed.

            Tip
            ~~~
            If ``phase_steps`` is ``None`, phase is not measured and only amplitude is measured.
        fresh_calibration : bool
            If ``True``, the calibration is performed without an existing calibration
            (any old global calibration is wiped from the :class:`SLM` and :class:`CameraSLM`).
            If ``False``, the calibration is performed on top of any existing
            calibration. This is useful to determine the quality of a previous
            calibration, as a new calibration should yield zero phase correction needed
            if the previous was perfect. The old calibration will be stored in the
            :attr:`calibrations` under ``"previous_phase_correction"``,
            so keep in mind that this (uncompressed) image will take up significantly
            more memory when saved.
        measure_background : bool
            Whether to measure the background at each point.
        corrected_amplitude : bool
            If ``False``, the power in the uncorrected target beam
            is used as the source of amplitude measurement.
            If ``True``, adds another step to measure the power of the corrected target beam.
        plot : int or bool
            Whether to provide visual feedback, options are:

            - ``-1`` : No plots or tqdm prints.
            - ``0``, ``False`` : No plots, but tqdm prints.
            - ``1``, ``True`` : Plots on fits and essentials.
            - ``2`` : Plots on everything.
            - ``3`` : ``test_index`` not ``None`` only: returns image frames
              to make a movie from the phase measurement (not for general use).

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            The contents of
            :attr:`~slmsuite.hardware.cameraslms.FourierSLM.calibrations["wavefront"]`.

        ------

    def wavefront_calibration_superpixel_window(self, superpixel_size):
        """
        Returns the window size for the interference regions.
        This is inversely proportional to the size of the superpixel because the
        superpixel and interference zone are separated by a Fourier transform.
        The computation works by estimating the spot size of the interference beams and
        then enlarging by a stored multiplier
        :attr:`_wavefront_calibration_window_multiplier`
        which defaults to 4.

        Parameters
        ----------
        superpixel_size : int
            The size of the superpixel on the SLM.

        into the desired phase correction and amplitude measurement. Applies these
        parameters to the respective variables in the SLM if ``apply`` is ``True``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        index : int
            The calibration point index to process, in the case of a multi-point calibration.
            In the future, this should include the option to request an "ij" position,
            then the return will automatically interpolate between the Zernike results
            of the local calibration points.
        smooth : bool OR int
            Whether to blur the correction data to avoid aliasing.
            If ``int``, uses this as the number of smoothing iterations.
            Defaults to 16 if ``True``.
        r2_threshold : float
            Threshold for a "good fit". Proxy for whether a datapoint should be used or
            ignored in the final data, depending upon the rsquared value of the fit.
            Should be within [0, 1].
        remove_vortices : bool
            A wavefront correct should be smooth when using smooth optics (lenses).
            However, incorrect phase wrapping can lead to phase vortices surrounding the
            exceptional points at the ends of improperly chosen branches.
            This is unphysical. If `True`, these exceptional points are eliminated
            halfway through the phase smoothing process. If `smooth=False`, this is
            ignored. The nature of vortex removal might add a global blaze to the
            pattern, so it is recommended to also set ``remove_blaze=True``.
        remove_blaze : bool
            If ``True``, removes the global blaze from the phase correction, as defined
            by the average blaze weighted by the measured power.
        remove_background : bool
            If the experimental background was not measured, this flag estimates the
            interference region's background by looking at the noisefloor of the
            measured power distribution. If the noisefloor is flat enough, the
            power is shifted to have a minimum at zero.
        apply : bool
            Whether to apply the processed calibration to the associated SLM.
            Otherwise, this function only returns and maybe
            plots these results. Defaults to ``True``.
        plot : bool
            Whether to enable debug plots.
