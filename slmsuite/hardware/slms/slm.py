class SLM(_Picklable):
    """
    Abstract class for SLMs.

    Attributes
    ------
    name : str
        Name of the SLM.
    shape : (int, int)
        Stores ``(height, width)`` of the SLM in pixels, the same convention as :attr:`numpy.ndarray.shape`.
    bitdepth : int
        Depth of SLM pixel well in bits. This is useful for converting the floats which
        the user provides to the ``bitdepth``-bit ints that the SLM reads (see the
        private method :meth:`_phase2gray`).
    bitresolution : int
        Stores ``2 ** bitdepth``.
    settle_time_s : float
        Delay in seconds to allow the SLM to settle. This is mostly useful for applications
        requiring high precision. This delay is applied if the user flags ``settle``
        in :meth:`set_phase()`. Defaults to .3 sec for precision.
    pitch_um : (float, float)
        Pixel pitch in microns.
    pitch : float
        Pixel pitch normalized to wavelengths ``pitch_um / wav_um``. This value is more
        useful than ``pitch_um`` when considering conversions to :math:`k`-space.
    wav_um : float
        Operating wavelength targeted by the SLM in microns. Defaults to 780 nm.
    wav_design_um : float
        Design wavelength for which the maximum settable value corresponds to a
        :math:`2\pi` phase shift.
        Defaults to :attr:`wav_um` if passed ``None``.

        Tip
        ~~~
        :attr:`wav_design_um` is useful for using, for instance, an SLM designed
        at 1064 nm for an application at 780 nm by using only a fraction (780/1064)
        of the full dynamic range. It is especially useful for SLMs which do not have builtin
        capability to change their voltage lookup tables (e.g. Thorlabs).
        Even so, the max lookup wavelength (:attr:`wav_design_um`) could be set larger
        than :attr:`wav_um` should the user want to have a phase range larger than
        :math:`2\pi`, for SLMs with lookup table capability.

    phase_scaling : float
        Wavelength normalized to the phase range of the SLM. See :attr:`wav_design_um`.
        Determined by ``phase_scaling = wav_um / wav_design_um``.
    grid : (numpy.ndarray<float> (height, width), numpy.ndarray<float> (height, width))
        :math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates of the SLM's pixels in wavelengths
        (see :attr:`wav_um`, :attr:`pitch_um`)
        measured from the center of the SLM.
        Of size :attr:`shape`. Produced by :meth:`numpy.meshgrid`.
    source : dict
        Stores data describing measured, simulated, or estimated properties of the source,
        such as amplitude and phase.
        Typical keys include:

        ``"amplitude"`` : numpy.ndarray
            Source amplitude (with the dimensions of :attr:`shape`) measured on the SLM via
            :meth:`~slmsuite.hardware.cameraslms.FourierSLM.wavefront_calibrate()`.
            Also see :meth:`set_source_analytic()` to set without wavefront calibration.

        ``"phase"`` : numpy.ndarray
            Source phase (with the dimensions of :attr:`shape`) measured on the SLM via
            :meth:`~slmsuite.hardware.cameraslms.FourierSLM.wavefront_calibrate`.
            Also see :meth:`set_source_analytic()` to set without wavefront calibration.

        For a :class:`.SimulatedSLM()`, ``"amplitude_sim"`` and ``"phase_sim"`` keywords
        store the true source properties (defined by the user) used to simulate the SLM's
        far-field.

        When :meth:`.fit_source_amplitude()` is called,
    phase : numpy.ndarray
        Displayed data in units of phase (radians).
    display : numpy.ndarray
        Displayed data in SLM units (integers).

        Warning
        ~~~~~~~
        Subclasses implementing vendor-specific software *should not* overwrite this
        method. Subclasses *should* overwrite :meth:`_set_phase_hw()` instead.

        Caution
        ~~~~~~~
        The sign on ``phase`` is flipped before converting to integer data. This is to
        convert between
        the 'increasing value ==> increasing voltage (= decreasing phase delay)' convention in most SLMs and
        :mod:`slmsuite`'s 'increasing value ==> increasing phase delay' convention.
        As a result, zero phase will appear entirely white (255 for an 8-bit SLM), and increasing phase
        will darken the displayed pattern.
        If integer data is passed, this data is displayed directly and the sign is *not* flipped.

        Important
        ~~~~~~~~~
        The user does not need to wrap (e.g. :mod:`numpy.mod(data, 2*numpy.pi)`) the passed phase data,
        unless they are pre-caching data for speed (see below).
        :meth:`.set_phase()` uses optimized routines to wrap the phase (see the
        private method :meth:`_phase2gray()`).
        Which routine is used depends on :attr:`phase_scaling`:

        -  :attr:`phase_scaling` is one.
            Fast bitwise integer modulo is used. Much faster than the other routines which
            depend on :meth:`numpy.mod()`.

        -  :attr:`phase_scaling` is less than one.
            In this case, the SLM has **more phase tuning range** than necessary.
            If the data is within the SLM range ``[0, 2*pi/phase_scaling]``, then the data is passed directly.
            Otherwise, the data is wrapped by :math:`2\pi` using the very slow :meth:`numpy.mod()`.
            Try to avoid this in applications where speed is important.

        -  :attr:`phase_scaling` is more than one.
            In this case, the SLM has **less phase tuning range** than necessary.
            Processed the same way as the :attr:`phase_scaling` is less than one case, with the
            important exception that phases (after wrapping) between ``2*pi/phase_scaling`` and
            ``2*pi`` are set to zero. For instance, a sawtooth blaze would be truncated at the tips.

        Caution
        ~~~~~~~
        After scale conversion, data is ``floor()`` ed to integers with ``np.copyto``, rather than
        rounded to the nearest integer (``np.rint()`` equivalent). While this is
        irrelevant for the average user, it may be significant in some cases.
        If this behavior is undesired consider either: :meth:`set_phase()` integer data
        directly or modifying the behavior of the private method :meth:`_phase2gray()` in
        a pull request. We have not been able to find an example of ``np.copyto``
        producing undesired behavior, but will change this if such behavior is found.

        Parameters
        ----------
        phase : numpy.ndarray OR slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram OR None
            Phase data to display in units of :math:`2\pi`,
            unless the passed data is of integer type and the data is applied directly.

            -  If ``None`` is passed to :meth:`.set_phase()`, data is zeroed.
            -  If a :class:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram` is passed,
               the phase is grabbed from
               :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.get_phase()`.
            -  If the array has a larger shape than the SLM shape, then the data is
               cropped to size in a centered manner
               (:attr:`~slmsuite.holography.toolbox.unpad`).
            -  If integer data is passed with the same type as :attr:`display`
               (``np.uint8`` for <=8-bit SLMs, ``np.uint16`` otherwise),
               then this data is **directly** passed to the
               SLM, without going through the "phase delay to grayscale" conversion
               defined in the private method :meth:`_phase2gray`. In this situation,
               ``phase_correct`` is **ignored**.
               This is error-checked such that bits with greater significance than the
               bitdepth of the SLM are zero (e.g. the final 6 bits of 16 bit data for a
               10-bit SLM). Integer data with type different from :attr:`display` leads
               to a TypeError.

            Usually, an **exact** stored copy of the data passed by the user under
            ``phase`` is stored in the attribute :attr:`phase`.
            However, in cases where :attr:`phase_scaling` not one, this
            copy is modified to include how the data was wrapped. If the data was
            cropped, then the cropped data is stored, etc. If integer data was passed, the
            equivalent floating point phase is computed and stored in the attribute :attr:`phase`.
        phase_correct : bool
            Whether or not to add :attr:`~slmsuite.hardware.slms.slm.SLM.source```["phase"]`` to ``phase``.
        settle : bool
            Whether to sleep for :attr:`~slmsuite.hardware.slms.slm.SLM.settle_time_s`.

        Returns
        -------
        numpy.ndarray
           :attr:`~slmsuite.hardware.slms.slm.SLM.display`, the integer data sent to the SLM.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If integer data is incompatible with the bitdepth or if the passed phase is
            otherwise incompatible (not a 2D array or smaller than the SLM shape, etc).

        -   ``"amplitude_radius"`` : float

            The radial standard deviation of the amplitude distribution in normalized units.
            For a Gaussian source, this is the :math:`1/e` amplitude radius
            (:math:`1/e^2` power radius).
            This is scalar and averages the :math:`x` and :math:`y` distributions.

            larger than ``extent_threshold``, where the maximum of the distribution is

            normalized to one.

            :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.toolbox.phase.zernike_aperture()`:
            Too small of a scaling is not good because amplitude would
            overlap outside where Zernike is defined, with divergent phase for higher
            order Zernike polynomials.
            Too large of a scaling is not good because one needs to use high order
            Zernike to attain sufficient spatial resolution at the center of the distribution.

        :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.toolbox.phase.laguerre_gaussian()`.
        Such generation works best when centered upon the source; a
