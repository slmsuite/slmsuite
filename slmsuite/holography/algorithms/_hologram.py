    r"""
    Phase retrieval methods applied to holography (DFT-based).
    See :meth:`.optimize()` to learn about the methods implemented for hologram optimization.

    Tip
    ~~~
    The Fourier domain (``"kxy"``) of an SLM with shape :attr:`slm_shape` also has the shape
    :attr:`slm_shape` under discrete Fourier transform. The extents of this
    domain correspond to the edges of the farfield determined by physical constants
    as :math:`\pm\frac{\lambda}{2\Delta x}` radians, where :math:`\Delta x`
    is the SLM pixel pitch. This means that resolution of the farfield
    :math:`\pm\frac{\lambda}{2N_x\Delta x}` radians can be quite poor with small
    resolution :math:`N_x`. The solution is to zero-pad the SLM nearfield
    --- artificially increasing the width :math:`N_x` and height
    :math:`N_y` while the extent of the non-zero nearfield data remains the same ---
    and thus enhance the resolution of the farfield.
    In practice, padding is accomplished by passing a :attr:`shape` or
    :attr:`target` of appropriate shape (see constructor :meth:`.__init__()` and subclasses),
    potentially with the aid of the static helper function :meth:`.get_padded_shape()`.

    Note
    ~~~~
    :attr:`target`, :attr:`weights`, :attr:`phase_ff`, and :attr:`amp_ff` are all
    matrices of shape :attr:`shape`. To save memory, the matrices :attr:`phase` and :attr:`amp`
    are stored with the (smaller, but not strictly smaller) shape :attr:`slm_shape`.
    Also to save memory, :attr:`phase_ff` and :attr:`amp_ff` are set to ``None`` on construction,
    and only initialized if they need to be used. Any code additions should check for ``None``.

    Tip
    ~~~
    Due to imperfect SLM diffraction efficiency, undiffracted light will
    be present at the center of the :attr:`target`.
    This is called the zeroth order diffraction peak.
    To avoid this peak, consider shifting
    the data contained in :attr:`target` away from the center.

    Tip
    ~~~
    For mixed region amplitude freedom (MRAF) capabilities, set the part of the
    :attr:`target` desired as a 'noise region' to ``nan``.
    See :meth:`optimize()` for more details.
    :class:`SpotHologram` has spot-specific methods for generated noise region pattern.

    Caution
    ~~~~~~~
    By default, arguments passed to the constructor (:attr:`phase`, :attr:`amp`, ... )
    are stored directly as attributes **without copying**, when possible. These will be
    modified in place. However, :mod:`numpy` arrays passed to :mod:`cupy` will naturally
    be copied onto the GPU and arrays of incorrect :attr:`dtype` will likewise be copied
    and casted. This lack of copying is desired in many cases, such that external routines
    access the same data, but the user can choose to pass copied arrays if this behavior is undesired.

    Attributes
    ----------
    slm_shape : (int, int)
        The shape of the **nearfield** device producing the hologram in the **farfield**
        in :mod:`numpy` ``(h, w)`` form. This is important to record because
        certain optimizations and calibrations depend on it. If multiple of :attr:`slm_shape`,
        :attr:`phase`, or :attr:`amp` are not ``None`` in the constructor, the shapes must agree.
        If all are ``None``, then the shape of the :attr:`target` is used instead
        (:attr:`slm_shape` == :attr:`shape`).
    shape : (int, int)
        The shape of the computational space in the **nearfield** and **farfield**
        in :mod:`numpy` ``(h, w)`` form.
        Corresponds to the the ``"knm"`` basis in the **farfield**.
        This often differs from :attr:`slm_shape` due to padding of the **nearfield**.
    phase : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        **nearfield** phase pattern to optimize.
        Initialized to with :meth:`random.default_rng().uniform()` by default (``None``).
        This is of shape :attr:`slm_shape`
        and (upon copying to :attr:`nearfield` during optimization)
        padded to shape :attr:`shape`.
    amp : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        **nearfield** source amplitude pattern (i.e. image-space constraints).
        Uniform illumination is assumed by default (``None``).
        This is of shape :attr:`slm_shape`
        and (upon copying to :attr:`nearfield` during optimization)
        padded to shape :attr:`shape`.
    nearfield : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        Helper variable to encode the data in
        :attr:`phase` and :attr:`amp` as a single complex matrix.
        This is of shape :attr:`shape`.
    target : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        Desired **farfield** amplitude in the ``"knm"`` basis. The goal of optimization.
        This is of shape :attr:`shape` in DFT-based algorithms, but differs for
        :class:`CompressedSpotHologram`.
    weights : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        The mutable **farfield** amplitude in the ``"knm"`` basis used in GS.
        Starts as :attr:`target` but may be modified by weighted feedback in WGS.
        This is of the same shape as :attr:`target`.
    farfield : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        Helper variable to encode the data in the farfield as a single complex matrix.
        This is of the same shape as :attr:`target`.
    phase_ff : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray
        Algorithm-constrained **farfield** phase in the ``"knm"`` basis.
        Used as a helper variable for optimization.
        Stored for computational algorithms which desire to fix the phase in the farfield
        (see :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize_gs`).
        This is of the same shape as :attr:`target`.
    amp_ff : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray OR None
        **Farfield** amplitude in the ``"knm"`` basis.
        Used for comparing this, the computational result, with the :attr:`target`.
        This is of the same shape as :attr:`target`.
    dtype : type
        Datatype for real arrays.
        The default is ``float32``.
    dtype_complex : type
        Datatype for complex arrays. The complex numbers follow :mod:`numpy`
        `type promotion <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html#type-promotion>`_.
        Complex datatypes are derived from :attr:`dtype`:

        - ``float32`` -> ``complex64`` (the default :attr:`dtype`)
        - ``float64`` -> ``complex128``

        ``float16`` is *not* recommended for :attr:`dtype` because ``complex32`` is not
        implemented by :mod:`numpy`.
    propagation_kernel : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray OR None
        Allows the user to target holography at different depths or aberration spaces.
        This is also applied for
        :class:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.FeedbackHologram`
        and subclasses to `~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.FeedbackHologram.measure()`
        the hologram at the desired plane.
        If ``None``, this feature is not used and no depth or aberration
        transformation is applied.
    iter : int
        Tracks the current iteration number.
    flags : dict
        Helper flags to store custom persistent variables for optimization.
        These flags are generally changed by passing as a ``kwarg`` to
        :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize()`.
        Contains the following keys:

         - ``"method"`` : ``str``
            Stores the method used for optimization.
            See :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize()`.
         - ``"fixed_phase"`` : ``bool``
            Fixes the farfield phase as mandated by certain weighted algorithms
            (see :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize_gs()`).
         - ``"feedback"`` : ``str``
            Stores the values passed to
            :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize()`.
         - ``"stat_groups"`` : ``list of str``
            Stores the values passed to
            :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.optimize()`.
         - ``"raw_stats"`` : ``bool``
            Whether to store raw stats: the raw image and feedback data for each
            iteration. Note that this can be a good amount of data.
         - ``"blur_ij"`` : ``float``
            See :meth:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.FeedbackHologram.ijcam_to_knmslm()`.
         - Other user-defined flags.

    stats : dict
        Dictionary of useful statistics. data is stored in lists, with indices corresponding
        to each iteration. Contains:

         - ``"methods"`` : ``list of str``
            Method used for each iteration.
         - ``"flags"`` : ``dict of lists``
            Each key corresponds to a flag that was used at least once. If it is ``np.nan``
            on a given iteration, then it was undefined at that point (update functions
            keep track of all this).
         - ``"stats"`` : ``dict of dicts of lists``
            Same format as ``"flags"``, except with another layer of hierarchy corresponding
            to the source (group) of the given stats. This is to differentiate standard deviations
            computed computationally and experimentally.

        See :meth:`._update_stats()` and :meth:`.plot_stats()`.

        Initialize datastructures for optimization.
        When :mod:`cupy` is enabled, arrays are initialized on the GPU as :mod:`cupy` arrays:
        take care to use class methods to access these parameters instead of editing
        them directly, as :mod:`cupy` arrays behave slightly differently than numpy arrays in
        some cases.

        Parameters additional to class attributes are described below:

        Parameters
        ----------
        target : numpy.ndarray OR cupy.ndarray OR (int, int) OR None
            Target to optimize to.
            The user can also pass a shape in :mod:`numpy` ``(h, w)`` form,
            and this constructor will create an empty target of all zeros.
            :meth:`.get_padded_shape()` can be of particular help for calculating the
            shape that will produce desired results (in terms of precision, etc).
            ``None`` is used internally.
        amp : array_like OR None
            The nearfield amplitude. See :attr:`amp`. Of shape :attr:`slm_shape`.
        phase : array_like OR None
            The nearfield initial phase.
            See :attr:`phase`. :attr:`phase` should only be passed if the user wants to
            precondition the optimization. Of shape :attr:`slm_shape`.
        slm_shape : (int, int) OR slmsuite.hardware.FourierSLM OR slmsuite.hardware.slms.SLM OR None
            The shape of the nearfield of the SLM in :mod:`numpy` `(h, w)` form.
            Optionally, as a quality of life feature, the user can pass a
            :class:`~slmsuite.hardware.FourierSLM` or
            :class:`~slmsuite.hardware.slms.SLM` instead,
            and ``slm_shape`` (and ``amp`` if it is ``None``) are populated from this.
            If ``None``, tries to use the shape of ``amp`` or ``phase``, but if these
            are not present, defaults to :attr:`shape` (which is usually determined by ``target``).
        dtype : type
            See :attr:`dtype`; the type to use for stored arrays. The user should choose
            this as a tradeoff between precision, memory size, and compute time.
        propagation_kernel : array_like OR None
            Primarily used for targeting holography at a different depth plane, encoded
            by a focusing kernel. :class:`MultiplaneHologram`, targeting several depth planes,
            must make use of this parameter to 'bake' the information for each plane
            into the composite hologram.
            A more advanced use of this feature is to
            target different positions in aberration-space, i.e. have a unique
            wavefront calibration baked into the hologram for each plane.

            The kernel must be of shape :attr:`slm_shape`.
            If ``None``, this feature is unused (the kernel is an ideal DFT).

            Tip
            ~~~
            The unit conversions necessary to convert a depth into a Zernike focusing
            parameter are stored in a ``cameraslm``, and can be accessed via

            See :attr:`phase`. :attr:`phase` should only be passed if the user wants to

        random_phase : float OR None
            Sets the phase to uniformly random phase, scaled to :math:`2\pi`.
            Setting ``random_phase`` to a fraction of 1 likewise scales the randomness.
            If ``None``, looks for ``"random_phase"`` in :attr:`flags`.
            This adds with the ``quadratic_phase`` parameter.
        quadratic_phase : bool OR float OR None

        Parameters
        ----------
        slm_shape : (int, int) OR slmsuite.hardware.FourierSLM
            The original shape of the SLM in :mod:`numpy` `(h, w)` form. The user can pass a
            :class:`~slmsuite.hardware.FourierSLM` or :class:`~slmsuite.hardware.SLM` instead,

        padding_order : int
            Scales to the ``padding_order`` th larger power of 2.
            A ``padding_order`` of zero does nothing. For instance, an SLM
            with shape ``(720, 1280)`` would yield
            ``(720, 1280)`` for ``padding_order=0``,
            ``(1024, 2048)`` for ``padding_order=1``, and
            ``(2048, 4096)`` for ``padding_order=2``.
        square_padding : bool
            If ``True``, sets the smaller shape dimension to that of the larger, yielding a square.
        precision : float
            Returns the shape that produces a computational k-space with resolution smaller
            than ``precision``. The default, infinity, requests a padded shape larger
            than zero, so ``padding_order`` will dominate.
        precision_basis : str
            Basis for the precision. Can be ``"ij"`` (camera) or ``"kxy"`` (normalized blaze).

        -   Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) phase retrieval.

            - ``'GS'``

              `An iterative algorithm for phase retrieval
              <http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ppoon/GerchbergandSaxton1972.pdf>`_,

              This is usually implemented using fast discrete Fourier transforms,
              potentially GPU-accelerated.

        -   Weighted Gerchberg-Saxton (WGS) phase retrieval algorithms of various flavors.
            Improves the uniformity of GS-computed focus arrays using weighting methods and
            techniques from literature. The ``method`` keywords are:

            - ``'WGS-Leonardo'``

              `The original WGS algorithm <https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.15.001913>`_.
              Weights the target amplitudes by the ratio of mean amplitude to computed
              amplitude, which amplifies weak spots while attenuating strong spots. Uses
              the following weighting function:

              .. math:: \mathcal{W} = \mathcal{W}\left(\frac{\mathcal{T}}{\mathcal{F}}\right)^p

              where :math:`\mathcal{W}`, :math:`\mathcal{T}`, and :math:`\mathcal{F}`
              are the weight amplitudes,
              target (goal) amplitudes, and
              feedback (measured) amplitudes,
              and :math:`p` is the power passed as ``"feedback_exponent"`` in
              :attr:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.flags` (see ``kwargs``).
              The power :math:`p` defaults to .8 if not passed. In general, smaller
              :math:`p` will lead to slower yet more stable optimization.

            - ``'WGS-Kim'``

              `Improves the convergence <https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.44.003178>`_
              of ``WGS-Leonardo`` by fixing the farfield phase
              strictly after a desired number of net iterations
              specified by ``"fix_phase_iteration"``
              or after exceeding a desired efficiency
              (fraction of farfield energy at the desired points)
              specified by ``"fix_phase_efficiency"``

            - ``'WGS-Nogrette'``

              Weights target intensities by `a tunable gain factor <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.021034>`_.

              .. math:: \mathcal{W} = \mathcal{W}/\left(1 - f\left(1 - \mathcal{F}/\mathcal{T}\right)\right)

              where :math:`f` is the gain factor passed as ``"feedback_factor"`` in
              :attr:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.flags` (see ``kwargs``).
              The factor :math:`f` defaults to .1 if not passed.

              Note that while Nogrette et al compares powers, this implementation
              compares amplitudes for speed. These are identical to first order.

            - ``'WGS-Wu'``

              Weights using an `exponential <https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.413723>`_
              function, which is less sensitive to near-zero values of
              :math:`\mathcal{F}` or :math:`\mathcal{T}`.

              .. math:: \mathcal{W} = \mathcal{W}\exp\left( p (\mathcal{T} - \mathcal{F}) \right)

              The speed of correction is controlled by :math:`p`,
              the power passed as ``"feedback_exponent"``.

            - ``'WGS-tanh'``

              Weights by hyperbolic tangent, commonly used as an
              `activation function
              <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function#Table_of_activation_functions>`_
              in machine learning.

              .. math:: \mathcal{W} = \mathcal{W}\left[1 + f\text{tanh}\left( p (\mathcal{T} - \mathcal{F}) \right) \right]

              This weighting limits each update to a relative change of :math:`\pm f`,
              passed as ``"feedback_factor"``, which is useful to prevent large changes.
              The speed of correction is controlled by :math:`p`,
              the power passed as ``"feedback_exponent"``.

        -   Conjugate Gradient (CG) phase retrieval.

            - ``'CG'``

              **(This feature is experimental.)**

              Some holography---especially that with more complicated holographic
              objectives---can be better treated with gradient-based methods.
              In these cases, the phase is guided to an optimized state by following the
              `back-propagated <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/autogradqs_tutorial.html>`_
              gradients (with respect to phase) of given objective ``loss`` which is
              passed as one of the :attr:`flags` to :meth:`.optimize()`.
              Weighting different components of the objective leads to tradeoffs between
              those components: for instance a tradeoff between power guided into a given
              pattern and the uniformity of the realized pattern.
              :mod:`slmsuite` uses :mod:`pytorch` as a backend for gradient computation.
              Notably, memory is still owned and initialized by :mod:`cupy`, but
              gradients can be calculated by using :mod:`pytorch`-:mod:`cupy`
              `interoperability <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/user_guide/interoperability.html#pytorch>`_.

              The objective ``loss`` is expected to be a :class:`torch.nn.Module`
              and defaults to a complex variant of ``torch.nn.MSELoss()``.
              ``loss`` is called in the style of :mod:`pytorch`, using (as arguments)
              the computed ``farfield`` (with gradient tree intact) and
              the ``target`` values for the farfield. Internally, this looks like:

              .. code-block:: python

                result = loss(      # The user provides this nn.Module to .optimize()
                    farfield,       # The farfield (with gradients), calculated from `phase` by slmsuite
                    target          # The target, initialized by the user and processed by slmsuite
                )
                result.backward()   # Gradients are back-propagated to the input `phase`.

              For :class:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.FeedbackHologram` and
              subclasses, the gradients are computed computationally, but the
              computational values are then replaced with the experimental results.
              This allows optimization of the experimental results using the
              computational gradients (correct to first order) as a guide.
              Currently, feedback is *not supported* for spot arrays with
              ``"experimental_spot"`` or ``"computational_spot"`` feedback
              (WGS probably works better for such spot array objectives anyway).

              Creating a custom objective is as simple as making a custom
              :meth:`torch.nn.Module.forward()` method.
              These methods can be as simple as
              `a single expression <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html>`_
              or as complicated as
              `a full neural network <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/modelsyt_tutorial.html>`_
              operating on the input parameters.
              However, remember to use :mod:`pytorch` methods because the arguments are
              of type :class:`torch.Tensor`.
              Here's an example of a custom :meth:`torch.nn.Module.forward()`
              which implements the `Huber loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss>`_:

              .. code-block:: python

                # Define the loss as a class.
                class HuberLoss(nn.Module):
                    def __init__(self, delta=1.0):
                        super(HuberLoss, self).__init__()
                        self.delta = delta

                    def forward(self, farfield, target):
                        residual = torch.abs(farfield - target)
                        quadratic = torch.clamp(residual, max=self.delta)
                        linear = residual - quadratic
                        loss = 0.5 * quadratic ** 2 + self.delta * linear

                        return torch.mean(loss)

                # Initialize the class. Remember that we can pass arguments (delta) here.
                loss = HuberLoss(delta=2.0)

                # Pass the loss to the hologram by one of two methods:
                hologram.optimize(..., loss=loss)       # 1. Pass as **kwarg.
                hologram.flags["loss"] = loss           # 2. Set directly.

              MRAF (next section), if desired, needs to be handled by the ``loss`` function.
              MRAF information is encoded in the ``target``, with the noise region being ``nan``.

        -   The option for `Mixed Region Amplitude Freedom (MRAF)
            <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10043-018-0456-x>`_ feedback. In standard
            iterative algorithms, the entire Fourier-domain unpatterned field is replaced with zeros.
            This is disadvantageous because a desired farfield pattern might not be especially
            compatible with a given nearfield amplitude, or otherwise. MRAF enables
            "noise regions" where some fraction of the given farfield is **not** replaced
            with zeros and instead is allowed to vary. In practice, MRAF is
            enabled by setting parts of the :attr:`target` to ``nan``; these regions act
            as the noise regions. The ``"mraf_factor"`` flag in
            :attr:`~slmsuite.holography.algorithms.Hologram.flags`
            allows the user to partially attenuate the noise regions.
            A factor of 0 fully attenuates the noise region (normal WGS behavior).
            A factor of 1 does not attenuate the noise region at all (the default).
            Middle ground is recommended, but is application-dependent as a
            tradeoff between improving pattern fidelity and maintaining pattern efficiency.

            As examples, consider two cases where MRAF can be useful:

            - **Sloping a top hat.** Suppose we want very flat amplitude on a beam.
              Requesting a sharp edge to this beam can lead to fringing effects at the
              boundary which mitigate flatness both inside and outside the beam.
              If instead a noise region is defined in a band surrounding the beam,
              the noise region will be filled with whatever slope best enables the
              desired flat beam.

            - **Mitigating diffractive orders.** Without MRAF, spot patterns with high
              crystallinity often have "ghost" diffractive orders which continue the
              pattern past the edges of requested spots. Even though these orders are attenuated
              during each phase retrieval iteration, they remain part of the best
              solution for the recovered phase. With MRAF, a noise region can help solve
              for retrieved phase which does not generate these undesired orders.

        Caution
        ~~~~~~~
        Requesting ``stat_groups`` will slow the speed of optimization due to the
        overhead of processing and saving statistics, especially in the case of
        GPU-accelerated optimization where significant time cost is incurred by
        moving these statistics to the CPU. This is especially apparent in the case
        of fully-computational holography, where this effect can slow what is otherwise
        a fully-GPU-contained loop by an order magnitude.

        Tip
        ~~~
        This function uses a parameter naming convention borrowed from
        :meth:`scipy.optimize.minimize()` and other functions in
        :mod:`scipy.optimize`. The parameters ``method``, ``maxiter``, and ``callback``
        have the same functionality as the equivalently-named parameters in
        :meth:`scipy.optimize.minimize()`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : str
            Optimization method to use. See the list of optimization methods above.
        maxiter : int
            Number of iterations to optimize before terminating.
        verbose : bool OR int
            Whether to display :mod:`tqdm` progress bars.
            These bars are also not displayed for ``maxiter <= 1``.
            If ``verbose`` is greater than 1, then flags are printed as a preamble.
        callback : callable OR None
            Same functionality as the equivalently-named parameter in
            :meth:`scipy.optimize.minimize()`. ``callback`` must accept a Hologram
            or Hologram subclass as the single argument. If ``callback`` returns
            ``True``, then the optimization exits. Ignored if ``None``.
        feedback : str OR None
            Type of feedback to use during optimization, for instance when weighting in ``"WGS"``.
            For direct instances of :class:`Hologram`, this can only
            be ``"computational"`` feedback. Subclasses support more types of feedback.
            Supported feedback options include the following:

            - ``"computational"`` Uses the the projected farfield pattern (transform of
              the complex nearfield) as feedback.
            - ``"experimental"`` Uses a camera contained in a passed ``cameraslm`` as feedback.
              Specific to subclasses of :class:`FeedbackHologram`.
            - ``"computational_spot"`` Takes the computational result (the projected
              farfield pattern) and integrates regions around the expected positions of
              spots in an optical focus array. More stable than ``"computational"`` for spots.
              Specific to subclasses of :class:`SpotHologram`.
            - ``"experimental_spot"`` Takes the experimental result (the image from a
              camera) and integrates regions around the expected positions of
              spots in an optical focus array. More stable than ``"experimental"`` for spots.
              Specific to subclasses of :class:`SpotHologram`.
            - ``"external_spot"`` Uses some external user-provided metric for spot
              feedback. See :attr:`external_spot_amp`.
              Specific to subclasses of :class:`SpotHologram`.

        stat_groups : list of str OR None
            Strings representing types of feedback (data gathering) upon which
            statistics should be derived. These strings correspond to valid types of
            feedback (see above). For instance, if ``"experimental"`` is passed as a
            stat group, statistics on the pixels in the experimental feedback image will
            automatically be computed and stored for each iteration of optimization.
            However, this comes with overhead (see above warning).
        **kwargs : dict, optional
            Various weight keywords and values to pass depending on the weight method.
            These are passed into :attr:`flags`. See options documented in the constructor.

        Caution
        ~~~~~~~
        This function should be called through :meth:`.optimize()` and not called
        directly. It is left as a public function exposed in documentation to clarify
        how the internals of :meth:`.optimize()` work.

        Note
        ~~~~
        Default FFTs are **not** in-place in this algorithm. In both non-:mod:`cupy` and
        :mod:`cupy` implementations, :mod:`numpy.fft` does not support in-place
        operations.  However, :mod:`scipy.fft` does in both. In the future, we may move to the scipy
        implementation. However, neither :mod:`numpy` or :mod:`scipy` ``fftshift`` support
        in-place movement (for obvious reasons). For even faster computation, algorithms should
        consider **not shifting** the FFT result, and instead shifting measurement data / etc to
        this unshifted basis. We might also implement `get_fft_plan
        <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/reference/generated/cupyx.scipy.fftpack.get_fft_plan.html>`_
        for even faster FFTing. However, in practice, speed is limited by other
        peripherals (especially feedback and stats) rather than FFT speed or memory.

        Parameters
